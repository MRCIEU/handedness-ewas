We report the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of left-handedness, a trait with low heritability for which epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed as an underlying etiological mechanism. 
* The **primary EWAS** of handedness was performed in two cohorts with DNA methylation data in whole blood (Illumina, 450k): 
    1. NTR adults (N=2,682 individuals including twins, mean age at methylation 36.5, standard deviation (SD) 12.7)
        *scripts*: [ntr/ewas_basic model_NTRadults.r] and [ntr/ewas_adjustrf model_NTRadults.r]
    2. ALSPAC adults (N=1,232, mean age at methylation 48.98, SD 5.55)
        *script*: [alspac/run-ewas.r]
* Summary statistics were combined in a meta-analysis (N=3,914) testing associations at 409,563 CpGs using METAL
    *script*: [combined/metal.txt] 
* We tested whether EWAS signal was enriched near loci detected in the previous GWAS on handedness (Cuellar-Partida et al, 2021). We carried out within-pair twin analysis in MZ twins discordant for handedness (Nadults= 133 twin pairs, Nchildren= 86 twin pairs). 
    *script*: [combined/gwas_followup.r]
* Secondary analyses were performed in different tissues
    1. In cord blood and peripheral blood in ALSPAC children (N=1,021 with DNA methylation data at birth, at 7, 17 years old, Illumina 450k chip, and/or at 24 years old, Illumina EPIC array)
        *script*: [alspac/run-ewas.r] 
    2. In buccal cells in NTR children (N=946 twins, mean age 9.5, SD 1.85, Illumina EPIC array)
* We then examined correlations between the effect sizes of top CpGs (defined as CpGs with the lowest p-value) in each analysis.
    *script*: [combined/correlations.r] 
* Finally, we created and tested polygenic and DNA methylation scores for left-handedness. 
    *scripts*: [alspac/run-scores.r], [ntr/methylation_scores_NTR.r], [ntr/explained_variance_NTR.r]
